# Unibrowse
Unibrowse is a comprehensive offline Unicode exploration tool. Users can browse
through all currently allocated Unicode blocks, perform searches for characters
by name, literal representation, or code point, and discover detailed
information about each character. Unibrowse makes navigating the vast world of
Unicode intuitive and educational, whether you're a developer looking for
specific code points, a linguist researching character sets, or just curious
about the symbols at your fingertips.

## Compilation
Those seeking to compile must have...

- Node.js 22.0

Once these requirements have been met, simply clone the repository and execute
`npm install` to download the project's dependencies, and `npm run build` to
compile the project. Once completed, the `apps/client/out` directory can then
be deployed to any web server.
